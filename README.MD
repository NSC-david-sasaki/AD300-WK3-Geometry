For the area of a triangle we use Heron's formula.

Area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-b))
Where semi-perimeter s = 1/2(a+b+c)

The triangle constructor assume equilateral sides, but can be manually defined with the setA, setB, and setC methods.

The rectangle constructor assumes a square, but can be manually defined with setHeight and setWidth.
